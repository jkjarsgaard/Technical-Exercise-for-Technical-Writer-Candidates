- Development Process

  It should be noted that .the author has rudimentary html skills, and where successful, was able to locate assistance online from sources like w3schools.com and similar online resources. A difficulty noted with these types of resources is that they are typically limited in scope, and have excellent information on the proper formats and syntax, but do not provide much assistance on applying a code within an existing document.

  1. Download the repository from the supplied link: https://github.com/CRMDoc/TechWriterTechnicalExercise
  2. Attempted to reference the jellyfish image file repeatedly with multiple searches to work out the correct syntax. This was not completed. The difficulty seems to lie determining the proper headers in the script. 
  3. Attempted to reference the __main.js__ file repeatedly, using the same methods as the image file reference. This was not completed for the same reason. I don't know enough about html syntax.
  4. Referenced the __styles.css__ file. This was successful, as  I was able to find a clear reference to the correct syntax. 
  5. Changed the href to link to Veeva.com. This was successful. I was able to locate a resource that explained the proper method to change  the href link.
  6. Modified the Click Here button to open Veeva.com as a new tab. Again, I was able to locate a good resource to determine the correct syntax.
  7. Attempted to separate the lorem ipsum text into two columns. Failed. The proper format has not yet been identified.
  8. Created a form between the banner image and the lorem ipsum text with:
     1. a _checkbox_ with a label
     2. a _picklist_ with the following values:
        - Inventory Monitoring
        - Order Management
        - MyInsights
     3.  a _text field_
     4.  a _submit button_
  9. Tried to fix the Header Bar so that it's static. I have not yet had sufficient time to attempt this.
  10. Attempted to modify the Click Here button to change color when a cursor hovers over it. Unsuccessful. Possible syntax was identified, but there are a number of variables that I have been unable to work out as yet.
  11. Fix the Header Bar so it doesn't overlap over the other elements. This was not attempted for time reasons.
  12. As the correct file was not successfully referenced I was unable to modify the hero image to span the full width of the page
  13. Changed the Click Here button from blue to Veeva Orange. This was relatively simple, by looking up the Veeva orange in text on a Veeva website, and inspecting the html code, the correct Veeva orange hex color was discovered (#f8991d) and then replaced the "red" in the Styles file.
  14. Did not work out how to display the "This is normally hidden!" text on the header bar due to time constraints.
  15. Did not Left align the "This is a Test Site" text on the top due to time constraints.
  16. Was unable to center the "Hello!"" text within the hero image as I was unable to get the hero image to display.
  17. Because I have not been able to align the lorem ipsum text into two columns, a light gray border around the two columns was not attempted.
  18. Changed the font of the text to Roboto by identifying the font in the styles file and changing it.
  19. Because I have not been able to align the lorem ipsum text into two columns, making  the right column link to Veeva.com was not attempted.
  20. Because I have not been able to align the lorem ipsum text into two columns, making  the background of the right column from white to gray when hovering wa snot attempted.
  21. For the requested form changes, it seemed that it was more important to reference the .js  file and get the rest of the elements to display properly before attempting to make adjustments to the form, The display changes requested for the form were not attempted, including:
      1. Setting the color of the form to gray
      2. Centering the form
      3. Giving the form a border radius 
      4. Ensuring that each input is on a separate line
  22. Setting the submit button to take up the entire width of the form was not attempted as the form was not modified.
